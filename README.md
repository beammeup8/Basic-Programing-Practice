# Basic-Programing-Practice
This project is a series of files with practice problems and
tests for various basic programming concepts in Python3. These
tests were written entirely as practice for those struggling to
grasp some concepts. I hope this is useful to someone.

## Files with a for loop focus
* [factorial](factorial.py)
* [various sums](various_sums.py)

## Files with a list focus
* [generate lists](list_gen.py)
